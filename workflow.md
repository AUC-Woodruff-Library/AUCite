# Big Picture Workflow for AUCite

- Create faculty WD item
- Find or create WD items for works by the faculty member, using the Author field (P50) to connect the work to the faculty member.
  - Make sure to search for items before creating them -- don't create a duplicate item!
- Use Google Scholar to idenitfy works by others that refrence/cite the faculty member's work. Find or add those works in WD, then add the cites work field (P2860) to link to the faculty member's work.
- From each of the faculty member's works, use the cites works field (P2860) to add cited works.
